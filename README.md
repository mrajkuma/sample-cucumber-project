<h2> Selenium Automation with Junit/Cucumber </h2>


</div>

## 💡 Overview

This project uses an alternate approach to the popular Page Object Model (POM). I call it function based approach. In addition it also generates an executable Jar which can be executed independently from any system.

## ✨ Features

- **🔐 Better code reusability . 
- **🌍 Ability to run from IDE and also using executable Jar.
- **🔍 Creates multi purpose functions for comon events and use them across pages.
- **📄 Simple and user friendly.
- **🎯 Production Optimization:** Built for speed and reliability in agile environments.
- **🔧 Customization:** Tailor settings and configurations to your needs.
